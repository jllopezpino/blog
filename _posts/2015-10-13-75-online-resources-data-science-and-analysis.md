This list is for those who want to become more comfortable working with machine learning libraries, numbers and statistics.

I've been making [a list of MOOCs related to data science](http://lopezpino.es/2013/12/20/interesting-mooc-courses-business-intelligence-big-data/) for a while. But it's not always easy to find one that fits your professional interests.
Not to mention that with the following resources, you can progress at your own pace.

In the end, this is just a compilation of links to posts, tutorials, video lectures and workshops that either [I've shared on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jllopezpino) in the last couple of years or that I have in my bookmarks.


# Machine learning

I selected those resources that are more suitable for beginners together with the parts of machine learning that I like the most.

* You can start with this [introduction to data mining](http://www.saedsayad.com/data_mining_map.htm) by Saed Sayad (University of Toronto). I found the first diagram particularly interesting.
* This [glossary of machine learning terms](http://ow.ly/K9LKz) is the best that I've found so far.
* An introduction to machine learning in [10 pictures](http://www.denizyuret.com/2014/02/machine-learning-in-5-pictures.html) is a short still great article to start with.

# Python

Python is my go-to language for most things these days and I got asked very frequently what are the best resources to learn programming in this language from scratch. Here it is my list:

* Codecademy has a [Python track](https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python) that seems suitable for both programmers who want to switch a new language and beginners to programming.
* If you prefer a book to learn programming, [Dive into Python](http://www.diveintopython3.net/) is the only one that I can recommend.
* I didn't want to list any MOOC here, but I'll make an exception with [this Python course](http://ow.ly/H56FJ).

Once you are familiar with Python, the following resources for machine learning and data analysis can take your skills to the next level:

* Video tutorials to learn [how to use Python's scikit-learn library to perform machine learning](http://ow.ly/PoAnU) by Kevin Markham.
* [3h+ in-depth introduction to machine learning with scikit-learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80fZrVMurPM) by Kyle Kastner (Université de Montréal) and Andreas Mueller (NYU Center for Data Science).
* [Machine learning cheat sheet for scikit-learn](http://peekaboo-vision.blogspot.de/2013/01/machine-learning-cheat-sheet-for-scikit.html) by Andreas Mueller.
* If you are interested in using neural networks in Python, Daniel Nouri explains [how to solve the Facial Keypoint Detection Kaggle challenge using Lasagne](http://ow.ly/LvvRf).
* If you don't have a technical background, you'll find very useful the scripts that you can find in [Practical Business Python](http://pbpython.com/).
* [Notebook Gallery](http://ow.ly/Ii1V7): links to the best IPython and Jupyter notebooks submitted by users.
* [Recipes of the IPython Cookbook](http://ipython-books.github.io/cookbook/) include excellent examples of how to use NumPy, scikit-learn and many other packages.
* Code snippets of some of the [most common operations with Pandas](http://ow.ly/wx6UQ).
* Make your first machine learning predictions using Python with [this Kaggle tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/details/getting-started-with-python).
* NLTK is the most popular library for natural language processing in Python. [This presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/japerk/nltk-in-20-minutes) can give you a good overview of what you can do with it and this [1 hour tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjzUxUKyAHG0UeXr09D7fP1srkx32MZQK) will show you what you can do with it.
* [PyDataTV](https://www.youtube.com/user/PyDataTV/playlists) is the YouTube channel of the PyData conferences. You can find keynotes, talks and workshops on how to use the PyData stack.
* [mpld3](http://ow.ly/JXRVP): interactive Matplotlib graphics in the browser and in IPython notebooks
* [EarthPy](http://ow.ly/HygsI) is a collection of IPython notebooks with examples of Earth Science data processing.

# R
I've been trying hard to like R. It's been in fact more than 5 years of trying to like it and I just simply prefer Python.
In any case, I still frequently launch an R prompt to use some fantastic packages that R has.

* [Intro to R](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsIK9qQfztXeybpHvru-TrqAP) is a playlist by Google Developers that explains all the basics of the language.
* Kaggle top ranker Xavier Conort listed [10 R Packages to win Kaggle competitions](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/04/top-10-r-packages-kaggle.html). That's a good way to discover some very prominent R packages.
* [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) is a terrific free book full of examples.
* "[R: the good parts](http://blog.datascienceretreat.com/post/69789735503/r-the-good-parts)" is an article by Jose Quesada (Data Science Retreat) that lists the main advantages of R with links to other good resources.
* Archetypal analysis is not usually taught in introductory machine learning courses. [This post](http://ow.ly/3xrTbg) explains how to apply it and shows that it outperforms kmeans in a number of cases. Plus, archetypal analysis is easier to interpret.
* [AnomalyDetection and BreakoutDetection](http://ow.ly/H8jTp): open source R packages for time-series analysis by Twitter.
* qdap is not only one of the best packages for natural language processing in R, but also one of the best documented. Use [the vignette](https://trinker.github.io/qdap/vignettes/qdap_vignette.html) to get started with it and later on [the manual](chrome-extension://oemmndcbldboiebfnladdacbdfmadadm/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/61803503/qdap.pdf).
* I know from my own experience that R's memory limitations can give you a headache. [These tricks](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1358003/tricks-to-manage-the-available-memory-in-an-r-session) are sometimes an effective painkiller. Also the slides "[Taking R to the Limit: Large Datasets](http://ow.ly/xCZvs)" might help.
* [statsTeachR](http://ow.ly/wXwue) is a repository of lessons for teaching statistics using R.
* Make your first machine learning predictions using R with any of [these four tutorials](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/details/new-getting-started-with-r).


# Databases and SQL
"If you're doing data science/analysis, learn SQL. People hate on it, but it's important. World of tech is built on it." [Greg Reda](https://twitter.com/gjreda/status/627205410987053056)

* If you want to know how a DBMS works, check the [videos of the Standford Introduction to Databases course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6hGtHedy2Z4EkgY76QOcueU8lAC4o6c3) by Jennifer Widom.
* Postgres has a feature-rich implementation of the SQL language and it took me about 1 year to master most of its features. You can find a very good overview of many of these advanced features of the languages in this video: [Postgres: The Bits You Haven't Found](https://vimeo.com/61044807)
* [Apache Calcite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_MyORYjq3w) is a query planner and optimizer for any kind of data sources. If you want to get familiar with how a 21st century query planner and optimizer looks like, this is a good starting point.
* Crosstabulation and pivot tables in Postgres are less arduous with the [tablefunc module](http://ow.ly/wXwsm).
* If you are a beginner to SQL and MySQL is your choice, try this tutorial that claims to cover [95-98% of everything you'll ever need to know in MySQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPu6qV5byu4) or [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOLL20iUUXg&index=33&list=PL32BC9C878BA72085).

# Spark, Hadoop and distribute computing

If you have to deal with large volumes of data, these are the resources that I can recommend:

* [Data Science training with Spark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTOgaMZkBKQ), a 5+ hour video from the Spark Summit.
* The [DatasFrames API](http://ow.ly/3xR1Ks ) will be the cornerstone of the future of Apache Spark.

# That's all

This list is obviously bias toward my preferences and experience. Moreover, I realised that some interesting topics as data visualization and experiment design are not properly covered.
That's why any suggestion in the comments of this post is more than welcome.
