Last weekend I shared the following slide from Joel Grus (author of the book [Data Science from Scratch](http://joelgrus.com/2015/04/26/data-science-from-scratch-first-principles-with-python/)):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What data scientists do? by <a href="https://twitter.com/joelgrus">@joelgrus</a> <a href="https://t.co/XydGa2yVax">pic.twitter.com/XydGa2yVax</a></p>&mdash; José Luis López Pino (@jllopezpino) <a href="https://twitter.com/jllopezpino/status/700956059930910724">February 20, 2016</a></blockquote>

Joel was giving his own version of a famous quote by [Robert A. Heinlein](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Time_Enough_for_Love), highlighting, with humour, the wide range of tasks that data scientists perform.
Because behind every joke there's always some truth, I decided to compile this list of tasks regularly performed by data scientists.


# Statistics and algebra

* Test a hypothesis ([Joel Grus](http://www.slideshare.net/SeaDAML/the-road-to-data-science-joel-grus-june-2015))
* Update a prior ([Joel Grus](http://www.slideshare.net/SeaDAML/the-road-to-data-science-joel-grus-june-2015))
* Measure the statistical dependence between two variables.
* Factor matrices ([Joel Grus](http://www.slideshare.net/SeaDAML/the-road-to-data-science-joel-grus-june-2015))
* Explain and interpret p-values 
* Apply regression analysis.


# Machine learning

* Understand the differences between different classification and clustering methods.
* Implement a machine learning method vaguely described in a paper.
* Run a regression ([Joel Grus](http://www.slideshare.net/SeaDAML/the-road-to-data-science-joel-grus-june-2015))
* Pretend to understand deep learning ([Joel Grus](http://www.slideshare.net/SeaDAML/the-road-to-data-science-joel-grus-june-2015))
* Evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms and use different error metrics
* Design an experiment ([Joel Grus](http://www.slideshare.net/SeaDAML/the-road-to-data-science-joel-grus-june-2015))
* Build a recommendation system.
* Extract knowledge with stream mining algorithms from data that you can't afford to process more than once.
* Engineer features from any existing dataset.


# Programming

* Program in R and Python (and Julia?).
* Write shell scripts ([Joel Grus](http://www.slideshare.net/SeaDAML/the-road-to-data-science-joel-grus-june-2015))
* Architect your software
* Write automated test cases


# Data management

* Write a SQL query ([Joel Grus](http://www.slideshare.net/SeaDAML/the-road-to-data-science-joel-grus-june-2015))
* Solve complex data aggregation problems.
* Pivot a dataframe
* Clean up messy data ([Joel Grus](http://www.slideshare.net/SeaDAML/the-road-to-data-science-joel-grus-june-2015))
* Optimize SQL queries and understand physical query plans.


# Large volumes of data

* Think in mapreduce ([Joel Grus](http://www.slideshare.net/SeaDAML/the-road-to-data-science-joel-grus-june-2015))
* Set-up a Hadoop cluster
* Write massively parallel algorithms


# Domain expertise

* Understand a business challenge and define data-related ways to solve it altogether ([@totopampin](https://twitter.com/totopampin/status/700972941836742656))
* Measure the business impact of your work
* Use data visualization to empower and inspire stakeholders


# Data extraction

* Scrape a web site ([Joel Grus](http://www.slideshare.net/SeaDAML/the-road-to-data-science-joel-grus-june-2015))
* Retrieve data from any API
* Measure the difference between two sequences
* Integrate data from different sources
* Process natural language
