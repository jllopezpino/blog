I just learnt that a FMI-Nielsen report predicts that
[online supermarkets will grab 20% of the American market by 2025](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/30/online-grocery-sales-set-surge-grabbing-20-percent-of-market-by-2025.html).
The leaders in [June 2016](https://www.kantarworldpanel.com/global/News/Global-e-commerce-grocery-market-has-grown-15-to-48bn) were South Korea (16.6% of the groceries are ordered online), Japan (7.2%) and UK (6.9%).
Surprisingly in USA this rate is only 1.4% and the Germany (1.2%) is the only industrial lagging behind the States.


It's been almost 7 years since I did my first order to an online supermarket.
I always had good experiences ordering on Tesco, Amazon Pantry and Rewe.
I'm surprised by how fast the market is changing.
Only 3 years ago features like barcode scanners or device consistency [were celebrated](https://econsultancy.com/blog/65330-14-cracking-ux-features-of-online-supermarkets/).

This is a short list of features that keep me buying at online supermarkets in 2017.

## Free delivery for VIP customers

You don't have to worry anymore about ordering a big bunch of things to don't pay an overcost.
If you are a good client, they will always deliver to you for free.

## Add to you calendar

It might sound stupid. But it was pretty annoying to open up my calendar to book some time for the delivery.
Now I can do it in only one click.
Sometimes I order a few days in advance, so it's more likely that they have all the products that I need.

## Nutrition facts label

I find extremely useful to be able to check the amount of sugar in each product before ordering them.
