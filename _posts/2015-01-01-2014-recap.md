2014 was a year full of hard work and achievements for me. Some of the best moments of the year (in chronological order):
<ul>
	<li>March: <a href="http://smergy.com">Smergy</a> began as a research project by Faisal Moeen and myself.</li>
	<li>April: I started to work at <a href="http://getyourguide.com">GetYourGuide</a> as Data Engineer in Marketing.</li>
	<li>May: I started tweeting regularly again,Â reaching out 300+ people and gaining roughly 100 new followers.</li>
	<li>September: I defended my thesis and graduated with my <a href="http://it4bi.univ-tours.fr">Master of Science</a>, specializing in 'Distributed and Large-Scale BI'.</li>
	<li>November: Guest speaker at <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jlpino/bds14-big-data-analytics-to-the-masses">Big Data Spain 2014</a>.</li>
